# Text-Mining-Projects



For IST565 Data Mining, David used machine learning methods to study an interesting language phenomenon - informal vs. formal language in French emails. He trained an automated classifier to predict formal vs. informal emails, and identified the linguistic cues that the classifier learned from sample data. His work may be further extended in the future to applications like sending student reminders of their writing style, or tracking language change over time using large corpora. This is a well-planned and well-executed project.

For IST736 Text Mining Homework 2, David used word frequency analysis and visualization techniques to discover the key skills that employers are looking for among data science job candidates (using data from Glassdoor.com). He's meticulous on data preparation, making well-thought-out decisions on what and how to preserve or discard when transforming semantic-bearing texts to numbers that computers can count, which ensures that his analysis results are reliable and convincing.
